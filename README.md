## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (custom properties, flexbox)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Outfit)
- No frameworks used – plain HTML and CSS

### What I learned

While building this project, I reinforced the following concepts:
.card {
max-width: 320px;
background: white;
border-radius: 1rem;
text-align: center;
padding: 1rem;
}

- How to structure a card layout using semantic HTML.
- How to use HSL values for better color control.
- The importance of a mobile-first and responsive design.
- Using Google Fonts (Outfit) and keeping font weights clean.

### Continued development

- In future projects, I’d like to:
  -Practice using rem/em instead of px for scalable design.
  -Explore using utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS.
  -Add dark/light mode toggle for accessibility.
